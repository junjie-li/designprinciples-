# Design In Glow

Design Principles Behind Glow || Revision 1.0.1
```


### **Is honest - Our design is clear and straightforward, beautiful design is functional design**

- Prefer using text over icons unless space not allowed or icons are super clear
- Avoid subtle hint, a walk through during on-boarding is often needed for better explanation
- `Typographic` Mobile view, text font size no less than 13px, on Web, no less than 16px
- Avoid using gray colors for text, unless you have a strong reason for that
- `Typographic` Avoid using Proxima Nova light, unless the text is large for readability
- Always check your design on phone instead of on a mac
- Take compatibility into consideration while designing (for example we design with Iphone 7 screen size, yet we need to think how it will look on an Iphone 4)
- Less use of popups, because they are told to be annoying


### **Is goal orientated - Our design decisions should always consider how we achieve our business goals as well as our customer’s goals**

- Ask yourself what is my design trying to solve/improve
- Ask yourself does my design serve the high level goals (can improve key metrics)
- Talk with PM on high level goals, what metrics to improve, understand how those goals are translated into product features
- Always start design with wireframing, explain them to PMs and exchange knowledge


### **Is analytical -  Our design decisions tied closely to the metrics performance, user research, knowledge exchange in the team**

- Ask yourself did we implement this similar design before, if so was it performing better or worse
- Put yourself into the shoes, will the users know how to use, Is there a better way to do so
- Understand how feasible is the design (evaluate engineering efforts, and how much to gain from this UI/UX)
- Together with PM, conduct user testing when there are big changes in the release
- Read customer feedback via reviews, reports from CX team
- Read weekly metrics reports and weekly product updates, get a basic understanding of the product performance
- For certain feature improvement, reach out to PA or PM to get more in depth understanding in performance
Take dev efforts into consideration, evaluate gains and losses 


### **Is delightful - Our design conveys positive emotions through engaging experience and playful interactions**

- Design rewarding experience (text/graphic feedback) every time user inputs
- leverage concept of gaming, design graphics/animations that are engaging, click worthy
- `Graphic` If a stock photo has human in it, better to include all races
- Avoid using grayish colors for background/overlays
- bold colors and layout are recommended  

### **Is systematic - Our design follows the best practices, every detail should has its own meaning**

- Pay attention to visual hierarchy, what do you want to highlight, what to deemphasis 
- Take considerations in what users will see in the first screen, to intentionally have cut off or ‘read more’ button at the bottom
- Always think can you simplify the page more, take out things is difficult than adding things
- Avoid using cards inside cards
- `Typographic` Left right padding for mobile are set to 16px for both ios and android, since android requires 8px times for responsiveness
- Consistency is important, stick to the color palette we have
- `Iconic` we don’t often use stroke icons, or other thin icons
- `Iconic` No more use than 3 colors
- `Iconic` for icons, we prefer flat icons, so no shadows applied
- `Graphic` Avoid using clipart like stock photos
- `Typographic` When making a poster/banner, make sure no widow, pay attention to line height
- `Typographic` No character spacing should be applied in the app UI going forward
- Avoid use of too much white space
